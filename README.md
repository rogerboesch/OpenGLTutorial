# OpenGLTutorial

### Introduction
This tutorial is not about how to create another game engine, but more on how to create simple games on different
platforms with almost no changes using OpenGL and C++.
For that reason the tutorial describes the boilerplate code needed on every platform and how to create a simple
**Game** class in C++ which contains all the game logic.


### The example game: Pong
I choosed Pong as the the  example game used in Part 1 to 4 of this tutorial because it just needs rectangles
to create it. In the next parts i will extend this then by creating more complex and fun games, even in 3D!

I hope you like the tutorial and it brings some light in the different OpenGL versions, how to use them and more important
how to implement it to become platform independent.
