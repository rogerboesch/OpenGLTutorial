# The (Multiplatform-) OpenGL Tutorial

### Content

This tutorial is not about creating another game engine but rather about creating simple games on different platforms with almost no changes using OpenGL and C++.
For that reason, the tutorial describes the boilerplate code needed on every platform and how to create a **2D Game** and, in later chapters, a **3D Game** that contains all the game logic.​​


### The example 2D game: Pong
I chose Pong as the example 2D game for this tutorial because it just needs rectangles to be created. In the following newsletters, I will extend this by creating more complex and fun games, even in 3D!


### The example 3D game: Battle Zone
Battle Zone is one of my all-time favorites. It’s a vector game created by the legendary company Atari. With its use of three-dimensional vector graphics, it only needs wireframe graphics and no textures, lights, etc. A great game to start with in 3D.

I hope you like the tutorial and it brings some light in the different OpenGL versions, how to use them and more importantly how to implement it to become platform independent.
